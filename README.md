# <b> FilmHouse </b>

This project is  purely built with react and css. 
The content of the project was built with JavaScript XML (JSX) and this is my first project with react. 
FilmHouse is a movie website interface for movies and uses OMDB API for its movies. Users cannot download movies from the site but can search for numerous movies and cartoons.
